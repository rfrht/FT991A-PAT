# Changelog

10/Aug/2020 - Revision Q, Lite Version
* Better Silk-Screen Pin 1 markings for Power regulators
* Larger footprint for 2SC5086
* Moving 0.1ÂµF transistor caps away from RF section
* Lots of re-routing
* Changing 1000 pF decoupling caps to _Low ESL_ type and 0805 footprint for better RF performance
* Took advantage of J310 [source & drain interchangeability](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-5/transistor-switch-jfet/) and rerouted component for better placement and signal routing.
* Labeled a few signals in Eagle file for better understanding of signal route/path
* Changed two resistors in Amplifier stage for extra 0.3 dB gain - and updated BOM
* Added ground pad

05/Jul/2020 - Revision P, Lite Version
* Repositioned the SDR Out port to right above the DC block cap
* Changed RF switch layout - now IF input uses the RF switch's `RFC` port instead of RF2 - The PE4259's `RF{N}` port gets in a grounded state instead of just reflecting out the data when the port is not selected/active. More details [here](https://github.com/rfrht/FT991A-PAT/wiki/appendix-pe4259-grounded-rf-port-when-port-is-not-selected)
* Got rid of the "Grounding" in RF1 port; that's not necessary because... Above
* Because of that... One less component (the 4.7 nF C2 cap)
* Few text corrections
* Added test pads for 9V, 3V and RF Switch
* A voltage line re-routed to the board edge, less ground plane disturbance

24/Nov/2019 - Lite Edition
* This revision features the bare minimum of the panadapter board: The TX signal RF switch and the Amplifier
* Greatly simplified and cheaper design
* More gain (due to less insertion loss of the RF switch chain that existed in previous revisions)

02/Nov/2019 - Revision O
* Board redesign
* Moved everything to the bottom side of the board, except for a RF switch and SDR/Scope unit ports
* Redesigned BPF (thanks to [SM0AOM](https://forums.qrz.com/index.php?threads/filter-design-help.671664/))
* Changed panadapter default state from disabled to enabled
* Changed RF front-end switch to use the TX9 signal instead of RX9
* Added a PTC fuse
* Choosed a simpler (and cheaper) 9V regulator

22/Jun/2019 - Revision N
* Removed the 5V regulator
* Removed the USB provisions
* Removed the G4HUP LPF. Reasoning: Found it of no use, since it cuts the signal 24 MHz above the IF center frequency. Replaced with a selectable 3-MHz wide 69.450 MHz BPF.
* Moved regulators to the top side of the board (to take advantage of heat dissipation)
* Moved the SDR Out port to the top of the board
* Added a large uncovered ground pad
* Tried to group the signals as much as possible and moved everything to the top of the board
* And thus, reduced significantly the BOM (35 to 25 different parts)

29/May/2019 - Revision M
EXPERIMENTAL.  In this revision:
* Got rid of the USB receptacle - Too much space in a tight radio
* Moved all GPIO pads to the upper board side
* Added a few missing Pin 1 references
* Renamed voltage regulators to somewhat shorter name
* Small re-routing - 9V regulator was entangled with capacitor

24/May/2019 - Revision L
EXPERIMENTAL.  In this revision:
* Added the ability to bypass entirely the amplifier and filters
  - Selectable by RF switch (default: off)
* Added a 3-pole Chebyshev Band-pass Filter centered at 69.450 MHz, 3 MHz
  wide
  - Selectable by RF switch (default: off)
* Revamped the Block Diagram
* Added the BPF LT-SPICE simulation
* Updated README, BOM, Gerbers and Pictures
* And yes, board is getting somewhat cluttered.

19/May/2019 - Revision K
* Changed footprints: BOM specifies 1206, project had 0805
  - Unified everything Resistors and Capacitors in 1206
  - Inductors are 0805
* A few routing enhancements
* Recalculated the component indexes
* Updated BOM to reflect the new component index
  - And also found a unaccounted resistor, whoops.
  - Reviewed the entire BOM and circuits. Now everything should be fine.

18/May/2019 - Revision J
* Changed SCPON signal to RX9
  - Added a Voltage Divider
* Changed the SMA-to-U.FL cable
* Added a few vias in large ground pads for voltage regulators
* Moved USB port a bit back in PCB

07/Apr/2019 - Revision I
* Created USB interconnection with the SDR
* Proper power management: Three voltage regulators in the board (9V, 5V, 3.3V)
* Power is only enabled with signaling coming from USB hub; otherwise, board quiesce
* Updated BOM

29/Mar/2019 - Revision H
* Revised routes in Cheb Filter - Made the tracks fatter and straighter
* Repositioned Q2 for better signal routing
* Better unit spelling in silk screen for resistors
* Flipped IF/SCP ports
* A few routing changes.

27/Mar/2019 - Revision G
* Removed a lingering DC blocker capacitor in filter in after RF switch.
* Added chokes in DC IN lines (3.3V and 5V) (yet another Gordon trick)

27/Mar/2019 - Revision F
* Added 1 nF capacitors in RF lines in PE4529 (except RF2, goes with a 470 pF to GND)
* Got rid of the VCC via which was crossing the RF line (argh)
* Finally got the courage to change a bit the board layout and escape from the thin strip that I was working previously.
* And another THANK YOU to Gordon AD5GG for his invaluable feedback

25/Mar/2019 - Revision E
* Changed the switch from a analog one (was a SN74LVC1G66) to a RF one (now: PE4259) (thanks to Gordon Hudson AD5GG)
* Now using 3.3V (because of PE4529)
* The switch default state now grounds the SDR
* Updated the list of contributors in PCB Silk Screen.

20/Mar/2019 - Revision D
* Moved to [OE2DOR](https://github.com/Lightning1984) **amazing** board design
* Added provision for two external inputs for latching control (actuating on a RF switch), isolating the SDR receiver when the two inputs are not in HIGH state. This is a bit of overkill in FT-991/A, but I want to be able to control the IF tap by software and be able to unplug it completely when not in use, without having to open the radio ;-)

### History (OE2DOR)

05/11/2018
 - Board Layout changed to fit neatly inside FT-991/A
 - Connection to IF using existing U.FL jumper cable 
 - Connection to FT991A SCP-UNIT using additional short U.FL jumper cable
 - Connection to SDR/SpectrumAnalyser using new U.FL to SMA cable
 - Mounting using M3/10mm PCB Spacer soldered to head of existing PCB mounting screw (since PCB mounting screw has no metric thread)
 - Fixation using M3 Plastic nut & screw sticking into tuning hole of shielding box
 - All but one resitor (1206) changed to 0805 to allow for smaller PCB layout

History (G4HUP/W3AXL)

12/10/2017
 - Up and running on a Yaesu FT-991/A

12/10/2017
